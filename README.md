## üöÄ Projects

### [ITRL Project](https://github.com/Goutami-Sooda/ITRL-Project)
Lead a team of eight members to build an interactive tool to inculcate coding skills in rural students through Kannada, a regional language of India. The central idea of the project was to allow users to convert programming logic in the form of Kannada algorithmic statements to Python code. I was actively involved in building a custom dataset, NLP model research and developing a web application using Django and React.
### [Loop Verse](https://github.com/Goutami-Sooda/Loop-Verse)
An educational web application for beginners in programming offering a wide range of features using Augmented Reality, OpenAI Assistant APIs and creative instincts. Ranging from AI-powered Debugger tool, and Trivia Question Bot, it offers a sophisticated visualizer tool using PythonTutor to clearly visualize the loop iterations and code. In addition, the Match Tiles memory game and AR Quizventure Instagram filter turn learning into a fun and enjoyable activity.

## üåê Open Source contributions

### [HPCC Systems - Conditional Cleanup after Regression Test](https://github.com/Goutami-Sooda/HPCC-Platform)
The project involved designing and developing conditional cleanup functionality to delete the workunits created during Regression Test in HPCC Systems. It is being built over the existing Regression Test Engine of HPCC Systems, an open source big data analytics platform. The project allowed me to gain experience in Python programming, and version control tools like Git and GitHub.
